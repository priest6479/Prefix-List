This Script was designed to auto generate Cisco Prefix-Lists

While remediating my current network I found it tedious creating prefix-lists, especially when yo uhave a list of 20 or 30 + prefix's

Creating a list couldn't be simpler, Drop your list of prefix's in the "prefixs.csv" file, execute the "prefix-list.py" script and see the results in the "prefix_list_config.txt" file.
